# A Note on Data Privacy & Storage 🛡️

This is a slightly unusual post, that has been close to my heart for a long time.

As both a **researcher** and an **internet user**, data privacy and data storage have become increasingly crucial over the years. 
This concern is not only about protecting *my own* data (never forget: **your online data are valuable**), but also about ensuring the safety and confidentiality of **research participants** and **collaborators**.

There is no such world where you have 'nothing to hide', because our world is constantly changing, both culturally and politically. Spread the word.

Without commenting further on the current global situation, I simply wanted to share a few practical solutions that can help maintain **at least some control over personal data**.

> ⚠️ This list is of course **non exhaustive** as I am not an IT engineer and because everyone must consider which practices and tools are best for their own situation.
> My idea is to provide suggestions that might be useful or inspiring for your own setup.  This post is a living document, intended to evolve over the years.
> **Feedback and additional suggestions are very welcome**

## Communication Tools

### 📱 iPhone iMessage
- One of the messaging services with **very limited governmental access**
- Designed and controlled by Apple
- Blocking iMessage would require blocking **entire telecommunications systems**, making it practically infeasible

---

### 📧 Email — Proton Mail
- Strong focus on **privacy and encryption**
- Allows the creation of **temporary security keys** when sending emails to non-Proton users (e.g., Gmail)
- Example:
  - You send an email from Proton to a Gmail address
  - The recipient receives a **secure link**
  - The message is opened directly on **Proton’s servers**, not Google’s

---

### 💬 Instant Messaging

#### ✅ Olvid (Highly Recommended)
- Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram, or Signal:
  - Each conversation establishes a **direct link between users**
  - No reliance on a **centralized server** nor cloud
- Strong identity-based cryptography

#### ⚠️ Signal (Fallback Option)
- Preferable to Meta-owned services
- Important note:
  - **Not linked to a phone number**
  - Smaller ecosystem and better privacy guarantees than most mainstream alternatives

## Data Storage

### 🗄️ Personal NAS (Network Attached Storage)
- Strongly recommended for:
  - Personal file storage
  - Photos and videos
  - Secure file sharing
- Advantages:
  - Full control over your data
  - No third-party cloud dependency
  - Can be set up in **half a day**

---

## Final Thoughts

Privacy-respecting tools are not about paranoia, they are about **responsibility**, especially in research contexts. 
Small choices, when combined, can significantly reduce unnecessary data exposure.

If you have tools, services, or workflows to recommend, feel free to share!
