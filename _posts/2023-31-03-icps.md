This year, ICPS convention took place in Brussels, Belgium, and it was a blast !
On the occasion, I shared our research proposal (MORALEM) about socioemotional response to moral transgressions
My poster, entitled Moral Appraisals of Transgressions and Outrages: A Perpetrator vs. Victim Focus Study,
is available on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369181792_Moral_Appraisals_of_Transgressions_and_Outrages_A_Perpetrator_vs_Victim_Focus_Study">Research Gate</a>
