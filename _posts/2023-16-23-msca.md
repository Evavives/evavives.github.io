I am delighted to announce that my project entitled <b>YourMorals - The role of social presence on moral decision-making: realistic settings for the understanding of utilitarian and deontological preferences </b>.
has been accepted for a 2-years funding Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship.

This research emerged a few years ago while I was working on impact of emotions on moral dilemmas with Yousri Marzouki and Olivier Oullier. 
Since then, I never stopped thinking that psychologists should consider a bit more social context to get a better picture of the processes associated with moral decision-making 
(because yes, moral choices are rarely made out of the social arena). 

Today I am so grateful to be able to start this post-doctoral position in UGhent for 2 years, alongside an incredible supevisor, <b> Prof. Emilie Caspar </b>. 

This project is at the cornerstone of a larger program of research I expect to settle down in the next years.

Information and details about my research are to come on my personal page. 
So let's keep in touch !
