I am delighted to announce that my project entitled <b>YourMorals - The role of social presence on moral decision-making: realistic settings for the understanding of utilitarian and deontological preferences </b>
has been accepted for a 2-years funding Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship with excellent evaluation.

This research emerged a few years ago while I was working on impact of emotions on moral dilemmas with Yousri Marzouki and Olivier Oullier. 
Since then, I never stopped thinking that psychologists should consider a bit more social context to get a better picture of the processes associated with moral decision-making - because yes, moral choices are rarely made out of the social arena. 
Beyond any doubt, this project is the cornerstone of a larger program of research I expect to settle down in the next years.

I am so grateful to start this position in one of the top-ranking universities in Europe (UGent you have my heart), alongside an incredible supevisor, Prof. Emilie Caspar. And because we are never alone, thank you to my close friends and my amazing partner for your unwavering support all along this process. 
Details (and surprises) about my research are coming soon on this page. So let's keep in touch !
