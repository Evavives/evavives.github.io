This fall I participated for the first time to the Cutting EEG worldwide summit. 
In the meanwhile of my very next position, I had the chance to come to visit my future host University, UGent, 
one of the 23 Cutting Gardens of this impressive 2023 edition. 

On the menu : MNE (python package) tutorial, introduction to the bayesian Hidden-markov models (HMM <3) and many interesting methodological talks. 
I was particularly absorbed by [Jelmer Borst](https://www.jelmerborst.nl/) and [Gabriel Weindel](https://gweindel.github.io/) latest work on HMM solutions. 
They adapted these models to decompose cognitive stages of single event-related potentials and developped a python-friendly package package adapted to ERPs analyses. 
Slides and package are available on their [Github repository](https://github.com/GWeindel/hsmm_mvpy).
