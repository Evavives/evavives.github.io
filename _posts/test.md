This autumn, I had the opportunity to attend the [Cutting EEG](https://cuttinggardens2023.org/) Worldwide Summit for the first time. 
During the transition to my upcoming position, I had the privilege of visiting UGent, my future host university, which was one of the 20 Cutting Gardens featured in this impressive 2023 edition.

On the menu : MNE (python package) tutorial, introduction to Bayesian Hidden-Markov models (HMM <3) and many interesting methodological talks. 
I was particularly absorbed by [Jelmer Borst](https://www.jelmerborst.nl/) and [Gabriel Weindel's](https://gweindel.github.io/) latest work on HMM solutions. 
They adapted these models to decompose cognitive stages of single event-related potentials and developped a python-friendly package adapted to ERPs analyses. 
Their slides and package are available on their [Github repository](https://github.com/GWeindel/hsmm_mvpy).
