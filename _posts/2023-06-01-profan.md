My PhD took part in a national and unprecedented experimentation (ProFAN project, funded by French
ministries MENJS and MESRI) aiming to investigate the effects of cooperative learning strategies on
social skills development and academic performance (N=10 000 students). The main goal of my doctoral
research was to investigate whether cognitive (i.e., working memory capacity) and psycho-social factors
(i.e., self-esteem, achievement goals) were involved during resource interdependent cooperation
operated through Jigsaw cooperative learning method.
