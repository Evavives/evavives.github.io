During my PhD, I had the opportunity to participate in the ProFan project, a large experimental research programme in psychology and education. 
This project was funded by two French ministries (MENJS and MESRI) and investigated the impact of alternative learning methods on
development of social skills and academic performance (N = 10 000 students). Of particular interest for my PhD was whether cognitive factors (i.e. working memory capacity) and psychosocial factors (i.e. self-esteem)
(i.e., self-esteem, achievement goals) were involved in resource-dependent cooperation, which was conducted using the jigsaw cooperative learning method.

Full contribution is available in French, on the[e-fran platform](https://e-fran.education.gouv.fr/utiliser-lapprentissage-cooperatif-pour-faciliter-lapprentissage-chez-les-eleves-en-difficulte/).
