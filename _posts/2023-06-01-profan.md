During my PhD, I had the chance to participate in the ProFan project,a large experimental program of research in psychology and education. 
This project was funded by both French ministries (MENJS and MESRI) investigated the impact of alternative ways of learning on
social skills development and academic performance (N = 10 000 students). Of particular interest, we examined whether cognitive (i.e., working memory capacity) and psycho-social factors
(i.e., self-esteem, achievement goals) were involved during resource interdependent cooperation operated through Jigsaw cooperative learning method.

Full contribution is available in French, on the[e-fran platform](https://e-fran.education.gouv.fr/utiliser-lapprentissage-cooperatif-pour-faciliter-lapprentissage-chez-les-eleves-en-difficulte/).
