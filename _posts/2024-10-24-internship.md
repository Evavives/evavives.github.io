A month ago, the team and I were happy to welcome Rozelin Vurgun for her internship in the Moral and Social Brain lab!
Rozelin is doing her Master at Kadir Has University (Turkey) and is currently doing an Erasmus internship as part of her training.
In our lab, she is using EEG to measure moral conflict under social presence (so much time spent in the UGent basement :') and in parallel is preparing a new study on surveillance effects (stay tuned for the results!).

PS. Don't hesitate to contact us if you are interested in an internship in our team :)
