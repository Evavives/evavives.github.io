A month ago, the team and I were happy to welcome Rozelin Vurgun for her internship at the Moral and Social Brain lab !
Rozelin is doing her Master at Kadir Has University (Turkey) and currently doing an Erasmus internship as part of her training.
In our lab, she uses EEG to measure moral conflict under social presence (so many time in the UGent basement :') and is preparing in parallel a new study on surveillance effects(keep posted for the results !).

PS. Don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in doing an intership in our team :)
