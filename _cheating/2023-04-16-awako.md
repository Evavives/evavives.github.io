I am delighted to announce that my project entitled <b>YourMorals - The role of social presence on moral decision-making: realistic settings for the understanding of utilitarian and deontological preferences </b>
has been accepted for a 2-year funding Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship with excellent evaluation.

This research project emerged a few years ago while I was working on the impact of emotions on moral dilemmas with Yousri Marzouki and Olivier Oullier. 
Since then, I never stopped thinking that psychologists should consider social context a bit more to get a better picture of the processes associated with moral decision-making - because yes, moral choices are rarely made out of the social arena. 
Beyond any doubt, this project is the cornerstone of a larger program of research I expect to establish in the next years.

I am so grateful to start this position in one of the top-ranking universities in Europe, alongside an incredible supevisor, Prof. Emilie Caspar.
More about my project is coming on this page. So let's keep in touch !
