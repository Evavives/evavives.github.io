The Moral & Social Brain Lab (Department of Experimental Psychology, UGent) is pleased to announce the availability of a 4 to 6 months Master's internship position for the year 2024.


<b class="term">Profile</b>: We are looking for highly motivated candidates with proficiency in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Candidates interested in developing their skills in these areas are also encouraged to apply.

<b class="term">Duration</b>: The starting date is flexible and can be scheduled between March and May 2024.

<b class="term">Objectives</b>: To analyse textual data from the web, collected through Google Alerts. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques will be applied, with two main tasks: the creation of a web-based corpus and the thematic classification of the text. 
Content will be extracted from the web pages (e.g. using a boilerplate removal algorithm) and duplicate documents will be removed (e.g. using the ONION corpus tool). 
The occurrences will be classified into fine-grained categories using sequential unsupervised learning (with text clustering programs) and supervised learning (e.g. TextCat).

In line with our research objectives, these suggested procedures can be adapted by the candidate throughout the internship, allowing them to be actively involved in the data generation and analysis processes.
Successful candidates will work under the guidance of Dr. Eva Vives (Postdoctoral Fellow) and Professor Emilie Caspar. 

<b class="term">Application</b>:
Applications should be submitted to (emilie.caspar@ugent.be) and (eva.vives@ugent.be)
