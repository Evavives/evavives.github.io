## My current position

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the
[Laboratoire d'Etude des Mécanismes Cognitifs](https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr/), in the beautiful city of Lyon, France. My research takes part in the MORALEM project ([more details here](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-21-CE28-0012)). In this research work, we investigate the role of third-party emotional reactions to (im)moral situations. In other words, we aim to determine to what extent anger, disgust and other moral emotions are activated during moral appraisals made by observers.

## About me
Hello ! I am Eva, and I am a social/cognitive psychologist. Why a slash ? 
I always believed one couldn't study individuals'cognitive processes separated from the social environment they occur. I therefore cultivated a scientific background straddling social psychology legacy and cognitive psychology. While I graduated from a Neuropsychology and Cognitive Psychology Master's degree (Aix-Marseille Université), I kept reading classical literature in sociology (Bourdieu, Goffman, Becker), social psychology (Tajfel & Turner, Allport, Nisbett..) and actively followed the latest theoretical development in the field (Markus & Kitayama, Fiske...). 

Then I defended my Ph.D at Aix-Marseille University, at the [Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/fr), in Marseille, France. This work took part in an unprecedented national experimentation, a.ka. the ProFAN project ([learn more about this project here])(https://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/16/Hebdo41/MENB1628228N.htm).
