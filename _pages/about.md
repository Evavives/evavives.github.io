## JOB ALERT !

We are looking for highly motivated candidates with proficiency in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. 
Candidates interested in developing their skills in these areas are also encouraged to apply.
The objective of this internship is to analyse textual data from the web, collected through Google Alerts. 
Natural language processing (NLP) techniques will be applied, with two main tasks: the creation of a web-based corpus and the thematic classification of the text. 
Content will be extracted from the web pages (e.g. using a boilerplate removal algorithm) and duplicate documents will be removed (e.g. using the ONION corpus tool). 
The occurrences will be classified into fine-grained categories using sequential unsupervised learning (with text clustering programs) and supervised learning (e.g. TextCat).

## My current position

I am a happy postdoctoral fellow at the [Social & Moral Brain Lab](https://moralsocialbrain.com/), located in the Department of Experimental Psychology of Ghent University (Belgium). 
My project, YourMorals, which was awarded a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101108680) individual grant for the years 2024-2026, explores the impact of mere presence of others on individuals’ moral preferences during conflictual moral dilemmas. 
This research uses a unique experimental system that mimics social context through face-to-face interactions, employing hyperscanning (EEG) techniques.
In parallel, I developp a standardized and realistic set of moral dilemmas addressing military, environmental, and medical issues to measure ‘real-life’ psychological processes of moral conflicts.


## About me
Hello ! I am Eva, and I am a social/cognitive psychologist. Why a slash ? 
I always believed one couldn't study individuals'cognitive processes separated from the social environment they occur. I therefore cultivated a scientific background straddling social psychology legacy and cognitive psychology. 

While I graduated from a Neuropsychology and Cognitive Psychology Master's degree (Aix-Marseille Université), I kept reading classical literature in sociology (Bourdieu, Goffman, Becker), social psychology (Tajfel & Turner, Allport, Nisbett..) and actively followed the latest theoretical development in the field (Markus & Kitayama, Fiske...). 

Then I defended my Ph.D at Aix-Marseille University, at the [Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/fr), in Marseille, France. This work took part in an unprecedented national experimentation, a.ka. the ProFAN project ([learn more about this project here](https://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/16/Hebdo41/MENB1628228N.htm)).
