## My current position

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the
[Laboratoire d'Etude des MÃ©canismes Cognitifs](https://emc.univ-lyon2.fr/), Lyon, France. My research takes part in the MORALEM project [more details here](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-21-CE28-0012). In this research work, we investigate the role of third-party emotional reactions to (im)moral situations. Or in other words, we aim to examine in what extend anger, disgust and other moral emotions are activated during moral appraisals.

## About me
Hello ! I am Eva, and I am a social/cognitive psychologist. Why this / ? 
While I graduated from a Neuropsychology and Cognitive psychology Master's degree, I always believed one couldn't study individuals'cognitive processes separated from the social environment they occur. I therefore cultivated a scientific background straddling social pschology legacy and cognitive psychology.

I defended my Ph. D at Aix-Marseille University, at the [Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive](https://lpc.univ-amu.fr/fr), Marseille, France. My Ph. D work took part in an unprecedented national experimentation, the ProFAN project [learn more about this project here](https://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/16/Hebdo41/MENB1628228N.htm).
